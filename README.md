# FarmTogether Test

The task is to code a light version of our registration flow that consists of steps. The key points to pay attention to are as follows:

1. Apply auto-complete to the "Country" field (can be hardcoded for now):

2. Run fields validation upon the click of the main yellow button;

3. Save the registered data to the local database (GitHub - typicode/lowdb: Local JSON database for small projects (supports Node, Electron and the browser) );

4. Please make sure that both front-end(ReactJs) and back-end are done using Typescript.
